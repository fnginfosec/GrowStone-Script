# Grow Stone Online Combine Tool
A quick bot I threw together while playing the mobile game Grow Stone Online. It uses PyAutoGui to scrape the screen and match identical stones together. I didn't want to do it manually and the auto method was too slow for my liking.

Programmed using Python3. A very basic script that did the job, but it has no exception handling at all. I quit the game shortly after so the script will be as-is. Tested and working on NoxPlayer.

##Basic Usage:
1. Install Python 3
2. Install PyAutoGui
3. Update images folder if necessary
4. Run script with item menu open (non-Beta GUI)
